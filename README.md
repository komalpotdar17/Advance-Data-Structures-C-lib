# Advance-Data-Structures-C-lib

In the world of software development, managing data efficiently is crucial. Whether it's storing information or performing complex calculations, effective data management is key. As software becomes more complex, there is a growing need for robust and flexible ways to manage data. This is where our project comes in! We've created a comprehensive library of tools to help organize and manage data, all using the C programming language.

## Features

Our library includes a variety of data structures, each designed to handle different types of data and operations:

- **Stack**: A simple data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: A straightforward data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Vector**: A dynamic array that grows as needed.
- **ArrayList**: A resizable array implementation.
- **LinkedList**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.
- **HashMap**: A structure that maps keys to values for efficient data retrieval.
- **Binary Tree**: A tree structure where each node has at most two children, used for efficient data organization.
- **Doubly LinkedList**: A linked list where each node points to both the next and the previous node.
- **Graph**: A structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, used to model relationships between objects.
